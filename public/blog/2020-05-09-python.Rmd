This blog is a brief review on using regular expression and the re.findall() function with multiple matches. 

## Re.findall() Function

The re.findall() function is an excellent tool in Python to look for and return all instances of a certain result in a string or list. There are special symbols and characters that can be used to return different results. Some examples of these symbols will be shown below.

We first must call the reticulate package to allow us to use Python within R. Another feature of the reticulate package is that we can share variables between R and Python. This will be shown in the example below. The first code chunk is R (defining test) and the second code chunk is Python (defining case and using the R variable):

This is a R code chunk:

```{r}
library(reticulate)
test <-"Reticulate is" 
```

This is a Python code chunk using the R variable:

```{python}
case = "really cool!" 
print(r.test,case)
```

## The "." symbol 

The "." symbol can be used to return any character. In the following example, the result will be anywhere in the string where there is an 'a' followed by any character. 

**Example:**

```{python}
import re
x = "abc aac ac acb bac a 123" 
re.findall(r"a.",x) 
  
```

## The "+" symbol 

The "+" symbol can be used to return the character you specified 1 or more times. In the following example, the result will be anywhere in the string where there is an 'a' followed by any 'a' immediately after it. 

**Example:**

```{python}
re.findall(r"a+",x) 
  
```

## The "d" symbol 

The "d" symbol can be used to return any digit character. In the following example, the result will be anywhere in the string where there is a digit character. 

**Example:**

```{python}
re.findall(r"\d",x) 
  
```


## The "()" symbol 

The "()" symbol can be used to return any specific group of characters. In the following example, the result will be anywhere in the string where it contains 'ac'. 

**Example:**

```{python}
re.findall(r"(ac)",x) 
  
```

## The "s" symbol 

The "s" symbol can be used for to return any whitespace. In the following example, the result will be anywhere in the string where there is an 'a' followed by any whitespace, followed by any digit. 

**Example:**

```{python}
re.findall(r"a\s\d",x) 
  
```
